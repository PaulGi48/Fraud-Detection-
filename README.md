Build a fraud detection software
This is a submission for Halogen'22 Cyber Competition
This is my python model of a fraud detection python that detects fraud in dataset(s)

SCOPE :
This model detects transaction fraud from a data set of international finance transactions.

DATA COLLECTION:
I used transaction records from "Acme Inc." - “the most famous brand that never was.” to arrange my cleaned analysis ; transaction_id,customer_id,amount,merchant,location,fraud.

NOTE

- Fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities or transactions.
- A fraud detection model is a complex task that requires a thorough understanding of machine learning techniques, data analysis, and web programming languages.
